Not my code; from a **React Ecosystems** course on **LinkedIn Learning**.

Some of the code relies on an API, the code for which is contained in the `react-ecosystems-server.zip` file. It's a bad practice to include source code in a ZIP like that, but oh well.

To run it, extract the code, go to the root directory for the folder, and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
